# Modeling-the-impact-of-riparian-hollows-on-river-corridor-nitrogen-exports
This repository contains all workflows and scripts used to generate input files for the 2020 study by Rogers et al. titled "Modeling the impact of riparian hollows on river corridor nitrogen exports" currently under review for publication in Frontiers in Water Special Issue: Linking Hydrological and Biogeochemical Processes in Riparian Corridors. The "Tutorial" document describes how to download all prerequisite software, generate unstructured grids using Gmsh, create hydrological boundary condition input files using HYDRUS-1D and R, create geochemical boundary conditions using R, and create the main input file for MIN3P. All data needed to create and run an example model are also included. For full context of this workflow, please refer to Rogers et al., 2020.
